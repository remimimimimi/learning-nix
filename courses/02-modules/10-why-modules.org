#+Title: Why modules?
#+SETUPFILE: ../../reveal.setup

** Modules are pure system configuration

** Consider two scenarios

\\

   + Package A installs /etc/service.conf
   + Package B installs /etc/service.conf

   Does installing Package B yield an error?  Or is the config
   overwritten?  Or can it be merged?

** 

Modules don't exactly solve this problem, instead they avoid it!

** Module basics

   #+BEGIN_SRC nix
     {
       imports = [ ./keyboard.nix ./development.nix ];

       
     }
   #+END_SRC
