** Some pointers

\\

   + Select the correct builders: ~mkDerivation~,
     ~pythonPackages.buildPythonPackage~,
     ~rustPlatform.buildRustPackage~, ...
   + Use TOFU when fetching the source, set the hash and re-run
   + You can define _environment variables_ in the derivation _(hint hint lol)
   + Flail around with your arms until I come help you
